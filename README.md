## 👨‍💻 Professional Summary  
Highly experienced **Software Developer** and **.NET Developer** with **7+ years of hands-on experience** delivering **large-scale, high-traffic applications** across web, mobile, game development, and backend services.

I have built and maintained **complex, production-level systems** with thousands of concurrent users — including **100+ published mobile apps & games** with over **2 million total users**. This practical experience has given me strong expertise in **scalable architecture**, **performance optimization**, and designing systems that grow smoothly as traffic increases.

My technical background includes building:

- **Enterprise-grade Web Applications**
- **High-performance RESTful Web APIs**

I am proficient in **C#, ASP.NET Core (MVC & Web API), Unity, Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design principles, OOP, Agile**, and the entire **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** — from concept and architecture to deployment and long-term maintenance.

Additionally, I have practical experience in **UI/UX design**, enabling me to create applications that are not only technically robust but also user-friendly and visually intuitive.

Driven by **clean code**, **scalable system design**, and building products that users truly enjoy.

⚠️ Note: Due to confidentiality agreements, I cannot publish some of my commercial projects on GitHub. However, I have uploaded several sample projects that represent my coding style, architecture approach, and practical experience.
