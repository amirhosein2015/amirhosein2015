## 👨‍💻 Professional Summary

**Senior Software Engineer** with 8+ years of experience designing and building **high-quality backend systems** using .NET, C#, and scalable distributed architectures. My work focuses on creating production-ready services built with Clean Architecture, DDD principles, and modern cloud-native engineering practices.

I specialize in ASP.NET Core, EF Core, SQL Server/PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized development workflows. I enjoy solving complex backend problems, optimizing performance, and designing maintainable, modular systems with clear domain boundaries.

I have delivered commercial-grade applications including e-commerce backends, B2B supply systems, API-driven services, and high-volume backend components. Additionally, have built and maintained **complex, production-level systems** with thousands of concurrent users — including **Many published mobile apps & games** with over **3 million total users**. This practical experience has given me strong expertise in **scalable architecture**, **performance optimization**, and designing systems that grow smoothly as traffic increases.

Current technical focus areas:

• Distributed systems and microservices

• Scalable API architectures and performance engineering

• Cloud readiness, observability, logging, and monitoring

• System design, domain modeling, and maintainability

Open to backend-focused roles, including:

• Senior Software Engineer

• Senior Backend Engineer

• .NET Backend Engineer

• Software Developer (Backend)

Motivated to build robust engineering systems, continuously improve, and contribute to high-impact products.


I am proficient in **C#, ASP.NET Core (MVC & Web API), Unity, Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), OOP, Agile**, and the entire **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** — from concept and architecture to deployment and long-term maintenance.

Additionally, I have practical experience in **UI/UX design**, enabling me to create applications that are not only technically robust but also user-friendly and visually intuitive.

Driven by **clean code**, **scalable system design**, and building products that users truly enjoy. I am a passionate lifelong learner, constantly studying emerging technologies to refine my craft, and I genuinely enjoy the art of programming.

⚠️ **Note:** Due to confidentiality agreements, I cannot publish some of my commercial projects on GitHub. However, I have uploaded several sample projects that represent my coding style, architectural approach, and practical experience.
